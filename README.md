# My Personal Project

## *Kaylana Sunluo*
<p>This application would be part of Transaction Processing System. The intended audience 
would include credit cards managers in a bank, and any other who needs to look into credit
cards information.</p>

This application would allow the users to:</br>
* display a credit card with all the details
* search for cards which need payment in the next certain days
* visualize the transactions for last month


<p>I had experience in designing a transaction processing system. It helps 
allows a bank to collect information from different sections online and 
build relationships among them. The bank could search for, edit and 
integrate data for further analysis. This project would be part of 
credit cards section and store structured data that allows managers to 
read and extract necessary information.</p>
